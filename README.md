# EDA-on-Diabetes-Dataset
This project applies machine learning techniques to predict whether a person is likely to have diabetes based on certain diagnostic measurements. It includes Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, and training/testing a machine learning model using Python.

📌 Project Overview

The objective of this project is to build a binary classification model to predict diabetes occurrence using a structured dataset. The process includes:
Performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand data distribution, relationships, and patterns.
Cleaning and preprocessing the dataset.
Applying machine learning models.
Evaluating the performance of the models.
